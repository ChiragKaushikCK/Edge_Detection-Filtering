🌟 Edge Detection Techniques with OpenCV 🌟
Welcome to the Edge Detection Techniques project! This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the power of edge detection using OpenCV in Python, showcasing methods like Sobel edge detection and Fourier Transform-based techniques. Whether you're a computer vision enthusiast or a curious learner, this project is designed to help you explore and visualize edge detection in images with a touch of flair! ✨

🚀 Project Overview
This project is a hands-on exploration of edge detection techniques applied to grayscale images. It leverages OpenCV and NumPy to process images, detect edges, and apply transformations like the Inverse Fourier Transform. The notebook includes code snippets for Sobel edge detection and frequency-domain filtering, with visual outputs to make the results pop! 🎨

🎯 Features

Sobel Edge Detection: Detects edges using Sobel operators in both X and Y directions, combining them for a comprehensive edge map.
Thresholding: Applies binary thresholding to enhance edge visibility.
Fourier Transform: Explores frequency-domain image processing with Inverse Fourier Transform to reconstruct images.
Visualizations: Displays original and processed images side-by-side for easy comparison.
Interactive Code: Well-commented Jupyter Notebook cells for clarity and learning.


🛠️ Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Libraries:pip install opencv-python numpy


Google Colab (optional, for running the notebook in the cloud)


💡 Note: The notebook uses cv2_imshow from google.colab.patches for displaying images in Colab. For local environments, replace cv2_imshow with cv2.imshow or use Matplotlib for visualization.


📋 How to Run

Clone or Download the Notebook:

Download Edge_Detection_Techniques.ipynb from this repository.
Alternatively, open it directly in Google Colab.


Install Dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy


Prepare an Image:

Place an image (e.g., Sample_Img.webp) in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code.
Ensure the image is grayscale-compatible or convert it within the notebook.


Run the Notebook:

Open Edge_Detection_Techniques.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab.
Execute each cell sequentially to see the magic happen! ✨
The notebook will display the original image, Sobel edge-detected images, and Fourier-transformed outputs.


Explore and Experiment:

Tweak parameters like threshold_value or Sobel kernel size (ksize) to see different effects.
Try different images to test the robustness of the edge detection techniques.

🧠 Code Breakdown
Here’s a quick overview of the key sections in the notebook:

Import Libraries:
import cv2
import numpy as np
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow


Sobel Edge Detection:

Applies Sobel operators to detect edges in X and Y directions.
Combines results using weighted addition and applies binary thresholding.

sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
sobel_combined = cv2.addWeighted(sobel_x, 0.5, sobel_y, 0.5, 0)
_, sobel_threshold = cv2.threshold(sobel_combined, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)


Inverse Fourier Transform:

Performs frequency-domain processing to reconstruct the image.

f_ishift = np.fft.ifft2(fshift)
img_back = np.abs(np.fft.ifft2(f_ishift))


Visualization:

Displays the original and processed images for comparison.

cv2_imshow(image)
cv2_imshow(img_back)




🌈 Customization Ideas
Want to take it further? Here are some fun ways to enhance the project:

Experiment with Thresholds: Adjust the threshold_value to fine-tune edge detection sensitivity.
Try Different Filters: Add Canny or Laplacian edge detection for comparison.
Color Images: Extend the code to process color images by applying edge detection to each channel.
Interactive Widgets: Use Jupyter widgets to create sliders for real-time parameter tuning.
Animation Effects: Create a video or GIF of the edge detection process for a cool visual effect.


🐛 Troubleshooting

Image Not Found: Ensure the image file path is correct (e.g., /content/Sample_Img.webp in Colab).
Display Issues: If cv2_imshow fails, try using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow for visualization.
Fourier Transform Errors: Verify that fshift is defined before applying the inverse Fourier transform. The notebook may require additional cells to compute the forward Fourier transform.
